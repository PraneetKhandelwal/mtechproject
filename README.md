#**A STUDY OF ONION PRICE FLUCTUATIONS IN INDIA**

1. This project contains the work done on the project 'Study Of Onion Price Fluctuations in India'.<br>
2. The 'data' folder contains all the data that we have obtained from the internet as well as the data that we have generated in the process(Labels of newspaper articles).<br>

5. The 'extra' folder contains all the files that were used for varios experiments and are just provided if need for some reference.<br>
6. To run the files in the 'scripts' folder, make sure they are in the same folder(because of the dependencies) and the 'data' folder should be in the same folder as these files. <br>
The command to run any file is 'python <filename>'.<br>
7. Library scripts are written in Python and R. So it is necessary that both
are installed on system.<br>
8. Packages required to run code can easily be downloaded from repos of
corresponding language.<br>

responding folder.
